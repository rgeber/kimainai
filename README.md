# KimaiNai

A CLI client for Kimai time tracking designed for people with strong aversions to time tracking and or Kimai.

## Motivation

Time tracking isn't for me. I reject it deeply and generally refuse to work by the hour. I just doesn't work for me.

However some contact with time tracking tools such a Kimai seems unavoidable at times. To minimize contact and keep my blood from boiling trying to enter a month's worth of work activity I simply wrote this CLI utility.
